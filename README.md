**Your Project's Name**
Saturday. [An ecommerce platform, selling different type of women shoes.]

**One or two paragraphs providing an overview of your project. Tell us about your project.**

The project focuses on developing an ecommerce platform tailored specifically for women's Apperals targeted for shoes and bags, aiming to provide a seamless and user-friendly shopping experience for customers seeking fashionable and comfortable footwear. It consist of a varity of style including flats, sandals, heels and bags with seasonal options like Chinese New Year 2024, Italy Collections and even a Modern day bags for everyday use. With an emphasis on user interface design, the website or application will offer intuitive navigation, allowing customers to easily browse, search, and filter products based on various criteria such as size, color, and brand.Additonally, it is responsive for mobile and tablet to ensure user satisfication. 

**Essentially, this part is your sales pitch.**

**Design Process**
**Provide us insights about your design process, focusing on who this website is for, what it is that they want to achieve and how your project is the best way to help them achieve these things.**

In our design process, we aim to target women who are looking for affordable shoes and bags. We want to ensure that our products are accessible to everyone, including students. Additionally, we've created games that provide users with offers and points that can be redeemed to offset their total expenses. This way, users can enjoy our products without overspending.

Typically, when shopping online, people either make immediate purchases or add items to their carts but don't proceed to checkout due to the high total cost. We want our users to have an enjoyable experience without breaking the bank. To achieve this, we offer more than just vouchers on specific days like 11.11 sales hence we enhance user interactions by providing additional offers. 

Our goal is to make affordable and stylish products accessible to all, ensuring that our users not only look good but also save money in the process.[only draft may add things after finishing the website.]

**In particular, as part of this section we recommend that you provide a list of User Stories, with the following general structure:**

**As a user type, I want to perform an action, so that I can achieve a goal.**
**This section is also where you would share links to any wireframes, mockups, diagrams etc. that you created as part of the design process. These files should themselves either be included as a pdf file in the project itself (in an separate directory) Include the Adobe XD wireframe as a folder. You can include the XD share url.** 

I will only do for the page that i have done for now which is index page for now, the rest not confirmed about the functionality. 

For index page, I have a navigation bar that will become transparent when you scroll all the way to the top and when scrolling down to the contents it will become white and stick to the top. Secondly, it will also have a slideshow of 10 seconds, also with a next carrot button for users if they would want to manually get

**Technologies Used**
<!-- In this section, you should mention all of the languages, frameworks, libraries, and any other tools that you have used to construct this project. For each, provide its name, a link to its official site and a short sentence of why it was used. -->

The Language i use is HTML, CSS and JavaScript. 

I also use additional libraries like : 
1. fa fa Icons - > i used it because it is very easy for to add icon just by using the <i class=""> function
 https://fontawesome.com/v4/icons/

2. CSS Fonts w3 school - > i used it because when i use google fonts it take very long to load and sometimes the code given doesnt work on my side so i used css font style to change my font style 
 https://www.w3schools.com/css/css_font_google.asp 

JQuery
The project uses JQuery to simplify DOM manipulation.

**Testing -> will do when done with my website**
<!-- For any scenarios that have not been automated, test the user stories manually and provide as much detail as is relevant. A particularly useful form for describing your testing process is via scenarios, such as: -->

Contact form:
Go to the "Contact Us" page
Try to submit the empty form and verify that an error message about the required fields appears
Try to submit the form with an invalid email address and verify that a relevant error message appears
Try to submit the form with all inputs valid and verify that a success message appears.
In addition, you should mention in this section how your project looks and works on different browsers and screen sizes.

<!-- You should also mention in this section any interesting bugs or problems you discovered during your testing, even if you haven't addressed them yet.

If this section grows too long, you may want to split it off into a separate file and link to it from here. -->
